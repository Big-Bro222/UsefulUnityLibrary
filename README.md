# UsefulUnityLibrary
This is a repository for saving useful libraries that I used during work (mostly with examples)  
The libraries are divided by branches using git checkout --orphan

Each branches represents an independent project collection
- [sqlite](https://github.com/Big-Bro222/UsefulUnityLibrary/tree/sqlite): An example for how to user SQLite in Unity.
- [Dotween](https://github.com/Big-Bro222/UsefulUnityLibrary/tree/Dotween): An example for Dotween in detail.
- [CSharpCollection (Under development)](https://github.com/Big-Bro222/UsefulUnityLibrary/tree/CSharpCollection): Examples for C# collections and generic collections
- [GPUSkinning](https://github.com/Big-Bro222/UsefulUnityLibrary/tree/GPUSkinning): An example for GPUSkinning with GPU instancing feature
