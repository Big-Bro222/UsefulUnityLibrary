# Getting Started

1. Clone the project and checkout to the `DOTween` branch
2. Open the project with any version of Unity beyond Unity 2017
3. Find the `Main` scene and open it. Navigate through each section to explore more
4. Most logic scripts in the example scenes are attached to the `BRAIN` GameObject 

# Note

1. Example scenes needs to be added into the  `File>buildsettings>Scenes` in build for the `Main` scene to work properly
2. To avoid UI layout Issue, resolution of `1920*1080` is recommanded
