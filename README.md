# UsefulUnityLibrary
This is a repository for saving useful libraries that I used during work (mostly with examples)  
The libraries are divided by branches using git checkout --orphan

Each branches represents an independent project collection
- [sqlite](https://github.com/Big-Bro222/UsefulUnityLibrary/tree/sqlite): an example for how to user SQLite in Unity.
- [Dotween (Under development)](https://github.com/Big-Bro222/UsefulUnityLibrary/tree/Dotween): an deep example for Dotween.
- [CSharpCollection (Under development)](https://github.com/Big-Bro222/UsefulUnityLibrary/tree/CSharpCollection): examples for C# collections and generic collections
